Akhil's Agent Playground

Hey! I'm Akhil, and this is my personal sandbox for building and experimenting with autonomous AI agents.

Most of the work here is built on n8n, connecting various AI models and tools to create helpful workflows. It's a "once in a generation" kind of tinkering space.

The Agents
Here's a lineup of the bots I've built/imported so far:

Finance Agent: A real-time financial analyst. It performs market research using SerpAPI and gives investment insights.
Travel Agent: Plans entire trips! Flights, hotels, and activities, all synced to my Google Calendar.
Research Agent: My go-to deep researcher. It searches the live web (via SerpAPI) and can also reference private documents (via Supabase RAG).
Research Agent Evals: A pipeline to grade my Research Agent's answers against a ground truth dataset.
Airbnb Agent: Scrapes and analyzes Airbnb listings to find the best spots.
Blog Post Agent: Automates SEO-friendly content creation.
Supabase RAG: A template for chatting with my own documents using vector search.
Tech Stack
Orchestration: n8n
Brains: OpenAI (GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini)
Eyes/Ears: SerpAPI (Google Search)
Memory: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector for RAG)
Project Status: Constantly evolving.

Credits Huge shoutout to Hamza Farooq and Traversaal.ai for the inspiration and foundation for many of these agentic workflows!
